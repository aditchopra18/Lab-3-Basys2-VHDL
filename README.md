# Lab-3-Basys2-VHDL
## Problems
Q: Implement a Hexadecimal Counter using VHDL on Basys 2 board. Write the Entity and Architecture Declaration and the Constraint File with appropriate comments. The counter, which is to be implemented using one of the 7 segment displays on the FPGA board, changes after every one second. After reaching "F" or "15", the counter resets back to "0". Also make the LEDs alongside blink in a binary fashion.

Q: Implement a Decimal Counter from "1" to "16" using VHDL on Basys 2 board. Write the Entity and Architecture Declaration and the Constraint File with appropriate comments. The counter, which is to be implemented using two 7 segment displays adjacent to each other on the FPGA board, changes after every one second. After reaching "15", the counter resets back to "0". Also make the LEDs alongside blink in a binary fashion.
